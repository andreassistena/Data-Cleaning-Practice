# Cleaning Dirty and Messy Data with Python 

##  Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a messy dataset using Python's powerful data manipulation libraries. The objective is to transform unstructured, inconsistent, or incomplete data into a clean, analyzable format.

This exercise demonstrates foundational data cleaning techniques that are essential for any data analyst or data scientist. It serves both as a practical skill-building activity and as a portfolio piece showcasing problem-solving with real-world data challenges.
